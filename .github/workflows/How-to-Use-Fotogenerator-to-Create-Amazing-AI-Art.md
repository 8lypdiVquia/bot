In this article, we will show you how to use Fotogenerator to create amazing AI art in three easy steps.
 
## Step 1: Choose a mode
 
Fotogenerator has two modes: photo mode and text mode. In photo mode, you can upload an image and choose a style to transform it. In text mode, you can enter a text prompt and let the AI generate an image based on it.
 
To switch between the modes, click on the icons at the top of the screen. You can also browse some of the featured gallery images for inspiration.
 
## Step 2: Enter your input
 
If you are using photo mode, you can either drag and drop an image file or click on the upload button to select one from your device. You can also use the camera icon to take a photo with your webcam.
 
Once you have uploaded an image, you can choose a style from the dropdown menu. There are many styles to choose from, such as anime, cubist, impressionist, and more. You can also adjust the intensity of the style with the slider.
 
If you are using text mode, you can enter a text prompt in the box. You can use phrases and commas to describe what you want to see. For example, you can type "a dragon flying over a castle at night" or "a cute cat wearing glasses and a hat". You can also use modifiers to specify details such as color, size, angle, lighting, etc.
 
Once you have entered a text prompt, you can choose a style from the dropdown menu. There are different styles for different types of images, such as 3D, cartoon, illustration, and more. You can also adjust the quality of the image with the slider.
 
## Step 3: Generate and download your image
 
After you have entered your input and chosen a style, click on the generate button to start creating your AI art. Depending on the mode and the settings you have chosen, it may take a few seconds or minutes for the AI to process your request.
 
Once your image is ready, you can preview it on the screen. You can also click on the compare button to see the original image (if you used photo mode) or the text prompt (if you used text mode).
 
If you are happy with your image, you can download it by clicking on the download button. You can also share it with your friends by clicking on the share button.
 
If you are not satisfied with your image, you can click on the generate button again to create a new one. You can also change your input or style and try again.
